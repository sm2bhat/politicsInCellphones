The author contextualizes Africa within in the rapidly changing global media and shows how patterns of media ownership and state control have evolved and the huge difficulties under which most African media workers labor. The author also explores the whole question of media ethics and professionalism in Africa. The general analysis is supported by a detailed case study of Cameroon.},

	abstract = {Gender, Race, and Social Identity in American Politics: The Past and Future of Political Access explores the ways in which cultural expression is represented in American politics as it intersects with issues of gender, race, and the construction of social identity. Specifically, this body of work examines how representations in the media and larger culture can establish and diminish the status of diverse communities of American politicians. Contributors analyze the rhetorical and performative changes that have occurred in America as it has shifted politically from growing acceptance and tolerance to an obscure—and often hostile—conservative ideology. This book contributes to the growing dialogue surrounding American politics by citing specific cases of gender and race-based infringements of the current political system, as purported by media and party players. This book will be especially useful to scholars of political science, media studies, gender studies, and critical race studies.},

In this paper, we investigate the impact of cellphone technology on violent collective action. We contend that the availability of cell phones as a communication technology allows political groups to overcome collective action problems more easily and improve ingroup cooperation, and coordination. Utilizing novel, spatially disaggregated data on cell phone coverage and the location of organized violent events in Africa, we are able to show that the availability of cell phone coverage significantly and substantially increases the probability of violent conflict. Our findings hold across numerous different model specifications and robustness checks, including cross-sectional models, instrumental variable techniques, and panel data methods.},

	abstract = {{PRISM} is a code name for a program under which the United States National Security Agency ({NSA}) collects internet communications from various U.S. internet companies. The program is also known by the {SIGAD} {US}-984XN. {PRISM} collects stored internet communications based on demands made to internet companies such as Google {LLC} under Section 702 of the {FISA} Amendments Act of 2008 to turn over any data that match court-approved search terms. The {NSA} can use these {PRISM} requests to target communications that were encrypted when they traveled across the internet backbone, to focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded earlier, and to get data that is easier to handle, among other things.{PRISM} began in 2007 in the wake of the passage of the Protect America Act under the Bush Administration. The program is operated under the supervision of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ({FISA} Court, or {FISC}) pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ({FISA}). Its existence was leaked six years later by {NSA} contractor Edward Snowden, who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as "dangerous" and "criminal" activities. The disclosures were published by The Guardian and The Washington Post on June 6, 2013. Subsequent documents have demonstrated a financial arrangement between the {NSA}'s Special Source Operations division ({SSO}) and {PRISM} partners in the millions of dollars.Documents indicate that {PRISM} is "the number one source of raw intelligence used for {NSA} analytic reports", and it accounts for 91\% of the {NSA}'s internet traffic acquired under {FISA} section 702 authority." The leaked information came after the revelation that the {FISA} Court had been ordering a subsidiary of telecommunications company Verizon Communications to turn over to the {NSA} logs tracking all of its customers' telephone calls.U.S. government officials have disputed criticisms of {PRISM} in the Guardian and Washington Post articles and have defended the program, asserting that it cannot be used on domestic targets without a warrant, that it has helped to prevent acts of terrorism, and that it receives independent oversight from the federal government's executive, judicial and legislative branches. On June 19, 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama, during a visit to Germany, stated that the {NSA}'s data gathering practices constitute "a circumscribed, narrow system directed at us being able to protect our people."},
